For 2023, I aim to be more purposeful in my reading: delve into new areas, revisit
books partially digested, and partake of what has enlightened or inspired friends.

Last but not least, I am setting out to have more fun and not overthink this.  Reading
daily should be a joy, not a chore.  As such, I may deviate from this but mapping out
the terrain beforehand should enable a more fruitful exploration.
